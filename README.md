# InternetSpeedTwitterBot
This Bot automatically checks your internet speed and compares it to the internet you were promised by your internet provider. If it is too slow, it will automatically send a message to the provider over twitter, letting them know that youre internet is too slow. I used the **selenium webdriver module**, as well as **object oriented programming** to complete this program, and the websites used are **https://twitter.com/i/flow/login** and **https://www.speedtest.net/**.

If you want to use the code yourself, just enter your credentials in the appropriate places. These places are the chrome webdriver path, your twitter login information, as well as your promised internet speed.

*You can potentially tweak the message send in the main.py, to directly @ the provider if you want to.*
